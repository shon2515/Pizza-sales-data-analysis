## 🔄 Data Preparation & Workflow

Raw transactional pizza sales data was stored in a single table named `pizza_sales`.

### SQL Workflow

SQL was used to:
- Aggregate sales and order-level metrics  
- Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
  - Total Revenue  
  - Average Order Value (AOV)  
  - Average Pizzas per Order  
- Prepare clean, analysis-ready datasets for dashboard visualizations  

Query results were exported to Excel for further analysis and visualization.
